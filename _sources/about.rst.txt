    My name is Sean Fang. I am a high-school student with a passion for data
    science, web development, and open-source software. I enjoy working on
    projects that allow me to apply my skills and learn new technologies.
    I am currently a student at Pensacola High School. In my free time, I
    enjoy tennis, reading, and exploring new technologies.
