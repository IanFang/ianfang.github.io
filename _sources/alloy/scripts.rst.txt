Data-driven Discovery of Chemical Short-range Order in NiCoCr Alloys Using API
*******************************************************************************

Slide 1: Title Slide (0:00–0:30)
================================
Hello everyone!
Today, I’ll be talking about a **data-driven method** to study **chemical short-range order**—or **CSRO**—in a **NiCoCr alloy**.
We’ll see how a new metric, the **Alien-philic Index (API)**, helps us understand material properties better.


Slide 2: Motivation (0:30–2:00)
===============================
Why should we care about this?
- Modern materials, like **multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs)**, are used in aerospace, medical implants, and energy systems.
- These alloys are **strong, lightweight, and resistant to corrosion**—great for advanced applications.

But there’s a **problem**:
- Their atoms often **don’t mix randomly**—some prefer to stick together, forming patterns called **short-range order (SRO)**.
- Understanding this order is **crucial** because it directly affects properties like **strength and toughness**.

**Why is this hard to study?**
- We rely on a tool called **Atomic Probe Tomography (APT)**, which creates **3D maps of atoms**.
- However, it can lose data and introduce errors during reconstruction.

**This is where our method comes in**—using machine learning and the API to make sense of the data and identify patterns.

Slide 3: MPEAs – A New Class of Materials (2:00–3:30)
======================================================
What are MPEAs?
- They are alloys made from **multiple main elements** instead of one dominant metal.
- The **NiCoCr alloy** I studied is an example.

Key properties:
- **High strength** and **toughness** even in extreme conditions.
- Great for **jet engines**, **spacecraft**, and **nuclear reactors**.

But these alloys aren’t **perfectly random**.
- Heat treatments and preparation methods can **change their atomic arrangement** and form **CSRO**.

Slide 4: Atomic Probe Tomography (APT) (3:30–5:00)
===================================================
How do we study these materials?
- **APT** lets us **see atoms one-by-one** by evaporating them with a strong electric field.
- We then use computers to **reconstruct** the data into a 3D model.

But there are **limitations**:
- Some atoms **don’t get detected**, so we lose data.
- The 3D models can have **errors** in positioning.

This makes it hard to identify **CSRO** patterns accurately.
That’s why we developed a **new method**—the **Alien-philic Index (API)**.

Slide 5: Chemical Short-range Order (CSRO) (5:00–6:30)
=======================================================
What is CSRO?
- It’s the **local ordering of atoms**—some atoms prefer to bond with specific neighbors.

**Why does it matter?**
- CSRO can affect how the material deforms under stress.
- It impacts properties like **yield strength**, **toughness**, and **hardness**.

**In short**—understanding CSRO helps us **design stronger, more durable materials**.

Slide 6: The Alien-philic Index (API) (6:30–9:00)
==================================================
What is API?
- It’s a **new metric** to measure CSRO.
- It calculates the **probability of finding a different atom** around a given atom.

**How does it work?**
- Machine-learning algorithms analyze **neighboring atoms** to identify patterns.
- It can handle **missing data** and **noise**, which is a big problem for APT.

Why is it called **Alien-philic**?
- “Alien” means **different element**, and “philic” means **loving**—it checks if atoms prefer to be near **different elements**.

Key advantage?
- It’s **simple** but **powerful** for detecting ordering patterns.

Slide 7: Case Study – NiCoCr Alloy (9:00–12:00)
===============================================
Now let’s look at a **real example**—the **NiCoCr alloy**.
- I prepared samples treated at **600 °C, 800 °C, and 1100 °C**.
- Then, I measured their **API profiles** and **mechanical properties** like strength and toughness.

Key findings:
- **800 °C** gave the **highest API values**, meaning **stronger SRO**.
- This sample also had the **highest strength and hardness**.
- At **1100 °C**, the SRO was weaker, making the material more **ductile** but **less strong**.

Slide 8: Results and Discussion (12:00–13:30)
==============================================
What does this mean?
- **API** accurately predicts **how SRO impacts properties** like strength.
- Higher SRO means **more resistance to deformation**—the material stays strong but may lose some flexibility.
- By **adjusting heat treatments**, we can **fine-tune SRO** to get the properties we need.

Slide 9: Conclusion and Outlook (13:30–15:00)
=============================================
In summary:
- We introduced the **Alien-philic Index (API)** to measure **CSRO** in complex alloys.
- API works even with **imperfect APT data** and gives **quantitative insights** into material properties.
- We showed that **API correlates with mechanical performance**, opening the door to **better material designs**.

What’s next?
- Use this method for **other alloys**.
- Apply **machine learning** to predict properties in **new materials** without long experiments.
