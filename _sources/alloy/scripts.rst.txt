Presentation Title: Data-driven Analysis of Chemical Short-range Order-Property
Correlations in MPEAs

[Title Slide - 30 seconds]
==========================

Good morning everyone. I'm Sean Fang, and along with my colleagues Alice Zhang,
as will as my advisors Dr. Cao, and Dr. Pu, we'll be presenting our work on
data-driven analysis of chemical short-range order in multi-principal element
alloys.

Introduction [3 minutes]
========================

Multi-Principal Element Alloys
------------------------------
Let's begin with an introduction to Multi-Principal Element Alloys, or MPEAs.
These are revolutionary materials composed of near-equiatomic proportions of
multiple elements. While they ideally form high-entropy solid solutions, in
practice, they often develop complex microstructures with short-range ordering.
This complexity makes them both fascinating and challenging to study.

MPEAs have gained significant attention due to their potential applications
in aerospace, energy, and structural materials. Their unique properties stem
from their complex atomic arrangements and interactions between different
elements.

Experimental Data Collection
----------------------------
To study these materials at the atomic level, we use Atomic Probe Tomography,
or APT to collect the data. This powerful technique allows us to map the
three-dimensional atomic structure of materials by analyzing evaporated ions
from a needle-shaped specimen. However, it's important to note that APT has its
limitations, including data loss and spatial resolution artifacts, which we'll
address in our methodology.

Chemical Short-Range Order
--------------------------
The focus of our study is Chemical Short-Range Order, or CSRO. This refers to
local compositional ordering within a few atomic shells. Unlike long-range
order, CSRO is characterized by short-range and layered structures, making it
particularly challenging to detect and quantify.

Methodology [4 minutes]
=======================

ML-aided Pattern Detection in NiCoCr Alloy
------------------------------------------
Our study focuses on an equiatomic NiCoCr alloy as a model system. It
represents a relatively simple but representative MPEA system that allows us to
develop and validate our analytical methods.

The animation demonstrates the 3D map of atomic positions in the NiCoCr alloy,
their project to xy and yz plains and the zoomed regions.

Data Analysis Plan
------------------
After the preparation of data, we will analyze it mainly with nearest neighbor-based methods and develop robust metrics to quantify CSRO.

Data Processing Pipeline
------------------------
Four main steps with sub-steps

Results and Discussion [6 minutes]
==================================
Data Loading and Labeling
-------------------------
After loading from files and labeling of elements, we obtained a dataset as
demonstrated with the first couple of rows.

Understanding Noise
-------------------
Our initial analysis focused on understanding and characterizing the noise in
our datasets. We developed histograms showing the distribution of outliers in
mass-charge ratios, which helped us establish robust filtering criteria.

Composition Analysis
--------------------
We performed detailed compositional analysis by counting atoms of each element
and analyzing their spatial distribution. This gave us baseline information
about the homogeneity of our sample.

Nearest Neighbor Analysis
-------------------------
One of our key innovations is the development of comprehensive nearest neighbor
analysis. We plotted distances of the ith nearest neighbor and created
histograms of nearest neighbor distances. These analyses revealed patterns that
helped us identify and characterize CSRO.

The Alien-philic Index
----------------------
We introduced a new metric called the Alien-philic Index (API), which measures
the percentage of alien atoms in the first K nearest neighbors. Deviations of
the API from ideal values suggest the presence of short-range order.

Structure-Property Correlations
-------------------------------
Our results show clear correlations between CSRO and mechanical properties:
- High levels of short-range order correlate with increased yield stress and toughness
- Lower levels of order appear to promote better ductility

These findings have significant implications for alloy design and optimization.

Conclusions [1.5 minutes]
=========================

Our work makes several key contributions to the field:

1. We've developed robust analytical methods to understand and quantify chemical short-range order in MPEAs
2. We've addressed key challenges in dealing with APT data limitations
3. We've established quantitative CSRO-property relationships that can guide future alloy design

These advances bring us closer to the rational design of advanced alloys with tailored properties.

Thank you for your attention. We welcome any questions.
