  - Atomic Probe Tomography (APT)
  - Chemical Short-Range Order (CSRO)

+ Methodology:

  - Equiatomic NiCoCr Alloy
  - Data processing and analysis

+ Numerical Results and Discussions
+ Conclusion

Multi-principal Element Alloys (MPEAs)
======================================
+ Near-equiatomic compositions of multiple elements
+ High configurational entropy solid solution ideally
+ Complex microstructures with short-range ordering in practical
+ MPEA Applications

Objective
=========
+ Address the challenges in chemical short-range order (CSRO) identification in
  MPEAs
+ Enable rational design of advanced alloys with novel properties by
  understanding CSRO-property relationships


Experimental Data Collection
============================
+ Atomic Probe Tomography  (APT) is a nanoscale characterization technique that
  maps the 3D atomic structure of materials by analyzing evaporated ions
+ Limitations:

  - Data loss and spatial resolution artifacts.
  - Challenges in detecting CSROs due to random noise.

+ Data-driven methods to mitigate the limitations

Chemical Short-Range Order (CSRO)
==================================
+ Definition:

  - Local compositional ordering within a few atomic shells

+ Characteristics:

  - Short-range and layered
  - Less complex than spatial SROs

+ Goal: Employ ML techniques to identify CSRO in APT datasets

ML-aided Pattern Detection in NiCoCr Alloy
==========================================

Data Analysis Plan
==================
+ Preparation:

  - Remove outliers and noise
  - Assign atomic labels to 3D point map

+ Nearest neighbor-based metrics:

  - Focusing on constitutional information
  - Mitigate intrinsic limitation of APT datasets

+ Quantitative CSRO indicator

  - To check correlation to properties
  - To lead new material/ preparation method design

Data Pipeline flowchart
=======================
+ Data Preparation

  - Data loading
  - Data labeling
  - Data quality assessment
  - Data cleaning

+ Exploratory Analysis

  - Spacial Density
  - Compositional Homogeneity

+ Visualization

  - 3D Distribution of Elements
  - Spatial Distribution Maps
  - Short-range order

+ Data Pipeline Development

  - Compute Alien-philic Index

Data Loading and Labeling
=========================
+ Load data files and data exploration
+ Assign element labels

Understanding noises
====================

Composition and Spatial Density Evaluation
==========================================
+ Chemical composition: counting the number of atoms of each element
+ Spatial analysis: atoms per cubic nanometer

Nearest neighbor-based analysis
===============================
+ Plot of distances of the ith nearest neighbor
+ Histogram of the nearest neighbor distances

Spatial Distribution Maps
=========================
+ Demonstrate periodicity of delta zs
+ A metric to estimate the degree of CSRO

AGI metric and Property
=======================
+ Alien-philic index (API) metric

  - The percentage of alien atoms in the first K nearest neighbors
  - More deviation of AGI metric from ideal value suggest high SRO

+ Mechanical Properties

  - High SRO leads to high yield stress and high toughness
  - Low SRO leads to better ductility

Conclusions
===========
+ Understand chemical short-range order (SRO) in multi-principal element alloys
  (MPEAs) is essential.
+ Addresses challenges of complex microstructures, APT data limitations, and
  the need for quantitative CSRO-property metrics.
+ Development of robust analytical methods and tools is crucial.
+ Enabling precise establishment of CSRO-property relationships is essential.
