Motivation
==========
- Address challenges in characterizing chemical short-range order (CSRO):

  * Complex microstructures in Multi-principal Element Alloys (MPEAs).
  * Limitations of Atomic Probe Tomography (APT) in data reconstruction and
    resolution.
  * Need for quantitative metrics to link CSRO to mechanical properties.

- Enable rational design of advanced alloys by understanding CSRO-property
  relationships.


Multi-principal Element Alloys (MPEAs)
======================================
- Definition and characteristics:

  * Near-equiatomic compositions of multiple elements.
  * Ideally high configurational entropy solid solution phases.
  * Actually, complex microstructures with short-range ordering depending on
    the synthesis and processing conditions.

- Deviation from random distributions with highest entropy due to:

  * Synthesis methods.
  * Thermal treatments.

- Focus on NiCoCr as a medium-entropy alloy (MEA) in our study:

  * Exceptional mechanical properties under varied conditions.

Atomic Probe Tomography (APT)
=============================
- Working principles:

  * Field evaporation for atomic-level mapping.
  * Ion detection and 3D reconstruction.

- Limitations:

  * Data loss and spatial resolution artifacts.
  * Challenges in detecting CSROs due to random noise.

- Incorporating machine-learning analysis and develop robust metrics to
  overcome limitations.

Chemical Short-range Order (CSRO)
=================================
- Definition:

  * Local compositional ordering within a few atomic shells.

- Characteristics:

  * Short-range and layered structure.
  * Influences deformation mechanisms, e.g., slip and twinning.

- Role in mechanical properties:

  * Yield strength, toughness, and hardness .

Alien-philic Index (API)
========================
- Definition:

  * Quantifies the probability of finding a different element in the first
    coordination shell.
  * Captures preference for heterogeneous neighbors, identifying CSRO intensity
    .

- Calculation methodology:

  * Machine-learning algorithms applied to APT data.
  * Accounts for data loss and noise during detection.

- Key advantages:

  * Tolerates random data loss.
  * Provides quantitative metrics for CSROs.

Case Study: NiCoCr Alloy
========================
- Sample preparation and heat treatments:

  * Conditions: 600 °C, 800 °C, 1100 °C.
  * Varied SRO states due to thermal processing.

- Experimental observations:

  * Higher SRO at 800 °C correlates with maximum yield strength and hardness .
  * Lower SRO at 1100 °C enhances ductility but reduces strength .

- Visualizing trends:

  * Stress-strain curves showing mechanical performance across samples .
  * API decay plots highlighting SRO intensities .

Results and Discussion
=======================
- Machine-learning validation of API predictions.
- Decay trends in API reveal short-range ordering within the first few atomic
  shells.
- Correlation between API and mechanical properties demonstrates tunable alloy
  design.

Conclusion and Outlook
=======================
- Contributions:

  * Introduced API as a robust indicator of CSRO in MPEAs.
  * Demonstrated API’s resilience to APT artifacts and data loss.
  * Correlated SRO intensity with mechanical properties for alloy design.
