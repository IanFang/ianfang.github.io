Question 1: What makes the Alien-philic Index (API) different from other methods used to study short-range order?
=================================================================================================================
Answer:
- Most existing methods rely on **statistical averages** or **simulations** that assume ideal conditions.
- The API is unique because it uses **real experimental data** and applies **machine learning algorithms** to handle **noise and data loss** from Atomic Probe Tomography (APT).
- It also provides **quantitative values**, not just qualitative descriptions, allowing us to **predict material properties** more accurately.


Question 2: How do you know the API results aren’t just random patterns in the data?
====================================================================================
Answer:
- The API results were validated by analyzing **patterns across multiple shells of neighbors**—if the order were random, there wouldn’t be clear trends in the **decay of API values** as we move farther from the center atom.
- We also compared the API values to **mechanical tests** like stress-strain curves, which showed **strong correlations** between API and properties like **strength** and **hardness**.


Question 3: Why did you choose NiCoCr as the test material instead of other alloys?
===================================================================================
Answer:
- NiCoCr is a well-studied **medium-entropy alloy (MEA)** with **excellent strength and toughness** under extreme conditions.
- It’s a **simpler system** compared to high-entropy alloys, making it easier to study CSRO effects while still demonstrating the importance of SRO in **real-world applications**.
- Its mechanical properties are **highly tunable** through heat treatments, making it a good candidate for showing how API can help **optimize material design**.


Question 4: Does API work for materials other than alloys?
==========================================================
Answer:
- Yes! While this study focused on NiCoCr, the API method can be applied to **any material** where **short-range order** matters.
- For example, it can be used for **ceramics**, **semiconductors**, or **energy-storage materials** where **atomic arrangements** affect properties like **conductivity** and **durability**.


Question 5: Can API predict mechanical properties without experiments?
======================================================================
Answer:
- Not yet, but that’s the **future goal**!
- Right now, API is based on **experimental APT data**, but with more datasets, we can train **machine-learning models** to **predict CSRO patterns** and **mechanical performance** without needing as many experiments.
- This could make designing **custom materials** much **faster and cheaper**.


Question 6: What are some limitations of the API method?
========================================================
Answer:
- One limitation is that it depends heavily on **APT data quality**, so **extreme data loss** can still cause inaccuracies.
- It also focuses on **local interactions** and may not capture **long-range ordering** or **complex phases** that form in some alloys.
- Finally, API calculations can be **computationally intensive** for very large datasets, so future improvements may involve **faster algorithms**.


Question 7: How does heat treatment affect the short-range order (SRO)?
=======================================================================
Answer:
- Heat treatment controls **atomic mobility**, which allows atoms to **rearrange** themselves.
- At lower temperatures (e.g., **600 °C**), atoms move **slowly**, resulting in **higher SRO** as they form **preferred bonds**.
- At higher temperatures (e.g., **1100 °C**), atoms move **faster**, leading to a **more random arrangement** and **weaker SRO**.
- By carefully **tuning temperature and time**, we can **optimize SRO** for desired properties like **strength or ductility**.


Question 8: Can this method be used to improve materials for specific applications like aerospace?
==================================================================================================
Answer:
- Absolutely! Materials like NiCoCr are already used in **high-stress environments** such as **jet engines** and **spacecraft**.
- With API, we can **fine-tune their properties**—for example, **increase strength for load-bearing parts** or **improve toughness** for parts exposed to **impact or vibration**.
- The method can also guide the design of **new alloys** for **next-generation applications**.


Question 9: How long does it take to analyze data using API?
============================================================
Answer:
- The initial **APT data collection** can take **a few hours**, depending on sample size.
- The **API calculation** is relatively **fast**, typically finishing in **minutes to hours**, depending on **data size** and **complexity**.
- With advances in **computing power**, we expect this process to become even **faster**, enabling **real-time analysis** in the future.


Question 10: What’s the most surprising result you found in your study?
=======================================================================
Answer:
- The most surprising result was how **strongly the heat treatment at 800 °C** affected **SRO** and **mechanical strength**.
- We found a **65.8% increase** in API values compared to other temperatures, directly correlating to the **highest yield stress** and **hardness**.
- It showed that **small atomic arrangements** can lead to **big changes** in **material performance**—something we can now **engineer on purpose**!
