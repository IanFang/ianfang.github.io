Kumaraswamy Exponentiated Odds Ratio Family: Mathematical Insights and Practical Applications
======================================================================================================

Overview
--------

This project introduces and explores the **Kumaraswamy Exponentiated Odds Ratio
(KEOR) family** of probability distributions, a flexible statistical framework
that unifies and extends several well-known lifetime models. The KEOR family
leverages the Kumaraswamy generator to provide enhanced control over
distributional shape parameters, enabling more precise modeling of skewed,
heavy-tailed, and complex real-world data.

The research emphasizes both **mathematical development** and **applied
performance**, combining theoretical derivation with practical evaluation on
reliability and biomedical datasets. Analytical properties such as moments,
hazard functions, and entropy are rigorously established, while computational
experiments assess the modelâ€™s adaptability in various statistical contexts.

Key Results
------------

- **Generalized Framework:** The KEOR family encompasses numerous existing
  distributions as special cases, offering a unified approach to model lifetime
  and reliability data.
- **Enhanced Flexibility:** Additional shape parameters provide improved
  control over skewness and kurtosis, leading to better data-fitting
  performance.
- **Closed-form Expressions:** Derived mathematical forms for key reliability
  measures, including hazard and survival functions.
- **Estimation Techniques:** Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods were
  developed for robust parameter inference, supported by simulation studies.
- **Empirical Validation:** Applied to real datasets from engineering and
  medical domains, the KEOR models outperformed traditional distributions such
  as Weibull and Burr in terms of AIC, BIC, and goodness-of-fit metrics.
