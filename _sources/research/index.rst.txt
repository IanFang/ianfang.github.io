      This project develops new statistical distributions to better model
      complex reliability and medical data. By extending classical lifetime
      models, it improves flexibility in capturing skewness, kurtosis, and tail
      behavior. The research integrates theoretical derivation with
      computational implementation, enhancing predictive accuracy and
      interpretability in engineering reliability and biomedical survival
      analysis. :doc:`More details <project1>`

      This project introduces and explores the **Kumaraswamy Exponentiated Odds
      Ratio (KEOR) family** of probability distributions, a flexible
      statistical framework that unifies and extends several well-known
      lifetime models. The KEOR family leverages the Kumaraswamy generator to
      provide enhanced control over distributional shape parameters, enabling
      more precise modeling of skewed, heavy-tailed, and complex real-world
      data. :doc:`More details<project2>`
