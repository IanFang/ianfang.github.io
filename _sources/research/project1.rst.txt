Advancing Reliability and Medical Data Analysis Through Novel Statistical Distribution Exploration
========================================================================================================

Summary
-------
This research focuses on enhancing the modeling accuracy and interpretability
of reliability and medical data through the formulation and analysis of novel
statistical distributions. The project introduces new families of probability
distributions designed to capture complex, real-world variability observed in
engineering systems and biomedical studies. These models address limitations of
classical distributions by incorporating additional parameters for greater
flexibility in skewness, kurtosis, and tail behavior.

Key Results
-----------
- Derived several new flexible lifetime distributions exhibiting superior fit
  to biomedical and reliability datasets compared to traditional Weibull and
  log-normal models.
- Demonstrated practical estimation algorithms enabling reproducible
  computational experiments in Python and R.
- Identified improved reliability measures and survival functions with
  potential clinical interpretation benefits.

The project contributes to both theoretical and applied statistics by enriching
the toolbox available for lifetime data modeling. In medical contexts, these
models enhance the ability to predict patient outcomes and treatment
reliability. In engineering reliability, they enable better risk assessment and
system optimization.
