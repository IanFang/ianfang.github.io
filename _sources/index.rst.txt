      Sean Fang
      ---------

      I’m Sean Fang, an IB senior who likes starting with “I don’t know” and
      ending with a model that explains something real. I am currently also
      a student research assistant at the Mathematical Intelligence and
      Neural Dynamics (MIND) Lab at the University of West Florida,
      supervised by Dr. Shusen Pu. I play piano, violin, and I like playing
      tennis and swimming. I love drawing and I like playing games, such as
      Minecraft. This site is my notebook: concise ideas, reproducible code,
      and the questions I’m still chasing.
